**PACT definition:** Identify two to three maps from the Risk Mapping exercise that highlight specific moments of risk that can be used to model a PACT in plenary. Explain that a PACT means choosing three contacts that are best suited to assist in a specific situation and ensuring there is a plan of action agreed beforehand. 

**Fishbowl exercise:** Choose one participant to roleplay themselves setting up a PACT. It may a good idea to ask someone who has already shared their risk map with the group as the particular risks and threats they face will already be familiar to the wider group. Ask the volunteer who they would choose as their three contacts in that situation (for example,it may be a husband, friend and colleague). Ask people from the room to come forward to play the role of the three contacts chosen. The person must act out how they would have a conversation with each of their chosen contact, explaining what is the Panic Button, why they have been chosen as a contact, and what they should do upon receiving the alert. At every point, the facilitator should encourage the room to question the rationale of the contacts chosen and participate in the discussion by making suggestions or raising problems they see. If it seems there could be a better contact choice (a lawyer might be better than the friend), replace that PACT contact with another roleplaying participant. Try roleplaying two fishbowls.

**Learning points:** This exercise aims to bring up valuable debate about the difference between choosing personal/familial contacts and colleagues/institutional contacts. On the one hand a family member may know the HRD most intimately and be equipped to respond quickest. On the other hand, they may have a more emotional response and could face direct risk that they are not aware of and prepared for. Participants are ecnouraged to safely and respectfully challenge one another to consider how reliable their chosen contacts would be in an emergency situation and to focus on preparation so that their chosen contacts would know what to expect and what would be expected of them in an emergency. It is also important to discuss the importance of regularly updating the chosen contacts for different situations; a contact who may be appropriate in the city may no longer be appropriate when making a long work journey to a remote region. Participants reflect on the importance of planning ahead to ensure there is always someone close at hand.

**Individual contacts:** All participants write on a flipchart who their three contacts would be in a certain scenario. They should outline who they are, why they chose them and what would be the main activities they expect from them. If time allows, ask participants to define two different PACT scenarios. Report back in plenary.

If you have more time, you could perform an actual asset/contacts mapping. In this kind of exercise you ask participants to list out (or represent in some way) the different kinds of assets or contacts they have. Thinking in terms of *assets* is helpful because it helps participants to think about what those can people can actually do if something goes wrong. For example, participants can list out contacts at NGOs/INGOs, embassies, NHRIS, EU/AU/UN, reporters, local authorities, military contacts, police, funders, etc. Once they have mapped out the assets, ask participants to map out which ones would/could have enough power to help them. This will help participants with realizing which assets are most helpful, and which relationships should be nurtured as part of their security strategy.
